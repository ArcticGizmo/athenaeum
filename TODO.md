- consider swiping to allow changing of star ratings
  - (use the touch event and on move recalculate value etc)
- make stars scale to width
  - might need to limit the height so that it doesnt look rediculous
  - maxHeight that limits the max width (so it is not huge)
  - this will potentially change how the calculation above works
